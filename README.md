# bubble-game

A simple and fun bubble clicking game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Overview

In this game, a grid of bubbles appears, each displaying a random number. Your goal is to quickly click the bubble that matches the "Hits" number displayed at the top. Each correct click increases your score and generates a new set of bubbles with a new target number. The game is timedâ€”see how many points you can score before time runs out!

## How to Play

1. Click the **Start** button to begin.
2. Look at the "Hits" value in the navbar.
3. Click any bubble whose number matches the "Hits" value.
4. Each correct click increases your score by 10 points and refreshes the bubbles and target number.
5. The timer counts down from 30 seconds. When time is up, your final score is displayed, and you can restart the game.
